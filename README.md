🎮 Tic Tac Toe in C++

    A simple terminal-based Tic Tac Toe game built using C++.
    This was one of my early C++ projects and focuses on basic logic and user interaction in the console.

🧠 Game Features

    🔢 2-player mode (play alternately from the same keyboard)

    🆓 Free to move anywhere on the grid

    ❌⭕ 3x3 board using standard characters

    🎯 Win detection for rows, columns, and diagonals

    🛑 Draw detection

🛠️ Technologies Used

    C++

    Console-based input/output

🚀 How to Run

On Linux/Mac:

    g++ tictactoe.cpp -o tictactoe
    ./tictactoe

On Windows (with MinGW):

    g++ tictactoe.cpp -o tictactoe.exe
    tictactoe.exe

⚠️ Requires a C++ compiler like g++.

📌 Notes

    This version does not include input validation or a computer opponent.

    It’s a basic implementation intended for learning and can be improved later.

    I plan to refactor and add features in future versions.
